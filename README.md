# Reflection

I created a stylish, responsive, and informative website for the New York museum, THE MET, featuring a contact form. Using vanilla JavaScript, SCSS, and HTML, I built the site from scratch. Developing this single-page website was extremely useful, as it allowed me to sharpen my HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript skills. The project enhanced my understanding of responsive design and interactive web development, providing valuable experience in creating functional and aesthetically pleasing web pages.
